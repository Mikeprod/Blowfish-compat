# Blowfish-compat
A C# version of the Blowfish cipher algorithm. Added the compat mode of this cipher method based on the source code of [Taylor Hornby](https://defuse.ca/source/blowfish.cs)
This compat (compatibility) mode ensures the right byte encoding on little-endian and big-endian Operating Systems.
